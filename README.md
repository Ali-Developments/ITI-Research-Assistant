# 🎓 ITI Research Assistant

An AI-powered **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application that enables students and researchers to upload academic papers and interact with them using natural language queries.

This project was developed as part of the **ITI Advanced NVIDIA DLI Course**.

---

##  Project Overview

The ITI Research Assistant helps users understand research papers by combining semantic search with Large Language Models (LLMs).

Instead of answering from general knowledge, the system retrieves relevant information directly from uploaded documents and generates grounded responses based only on document content.

---

## Try It Yourself (Live Deployment)

The application is publicly deployed on Streamlit Cloud, allowing You to test the full RAG system without local setup.

You can:

- Upload your own PDF/DOCX research paper

- Ask domain-specific questions

- View context-grounded answers

- Generate structured summaries

##  Project Explanation

The system follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline:

1. **Document Upload**
   - Users upload research papers in PDF or DOCX format.

2. **Text Extraction**
   - The system extracts textual content from documents.

3. **Chunking**
   - Documents are divided into smaller chunks for efficient processing.

4. **Embedding Generation**
   - Text chunks are converted into embeddings using HuggingFace models.

5. **Vector Database**
   - Embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector store.

6. **Semantic Retrieval**
   - Relevant document sections are retrieved based on user queries.

7. **LLM Response Generation**
   - Retrieved context is passed to a Groq-hosted LLaMA3 model to generate accurate answers.
